## About This Component  
This is a **modular Inventory Component** implemented entirely in Blueprints.  

- Designed to be added to your project as a standalone inventory system.  
- âš¡ Fully replicated for multiplayer support.  
- ðŸ›  Blueprint-onlyâ€”no C++ required!  

## Features  
âœ” Modular Inventory Component  
âœ” Supports Pickup & Item Management  
âœ” Multiplayer-ready with replication  
âœ” 100% Blueprint-based  

## Inventory System Overview  
- The component `BPI_Inventory` can be added to your character (e.g., `CBP_Character`) to enable pickup functionality.  
- Inventory functionality and assets are organized inside the `"Inventory"` folder.  

## Setup and Usage  

**Detailed setup instructions:**  

1. Open your Character Blueprint.  
2. In **Class Settings**, add the interface **BPI_Inventory**.  
3. Add the component **AC_Inventory** to your Character.  
4. Under **My Blueprints â†’ Interfaces â†’ PickupItem**, copy the existing interface implementation from the **InstructionExample** into your Character Blueprint.  
5. Compile and save your Character Blueprint.  
6. On the right side, select the **AC_Inventory** component (it will be highlighted in pink).  
7. Inside the component, find the functions that control how the inventory works and add those functions to your Character Blueprint as needed.  

**To add new items:**  
- Locate the Data Table `DT_Inventory` and add new entries following the existing format.  

**To spawn pickup items in the world:**  
- Open `Content â†’ Inventory â†’ Blueprints`.  
- Place instances of `BP_Pickup` in your level.  
- In the Details panel for each `BP_Pickup`, set the **ID** to match an item in `DT_Inventory`.  

**Instructions and examples are also available at:**  
`/inventory/blueprint/InstructionExample`

### Future Plans  
- Support for Data Assets planned  
- More documentation and examples in the InstructionExample blueprint  
- Additional modular features and improvements
